Self Extraction/Packager

Setup the directory structure

In the payload (build output) directory create 
- the initial 'files'.tar file for later packaging 
- the 'installer' script is for any 'post-unpacking' steps
The build script is to generate the payload.tar.gz delivery file
The decompress script is run to extract the payload.tar.gz and run the installer script

Process:
1. Execute application build sending output to payload (includes tarring up build output and adding installer script)
2. Run 'build' script to create the self-extracting package
3. Archive new build package in artifactory
4. For Deployment, download and run the new build package on targets
