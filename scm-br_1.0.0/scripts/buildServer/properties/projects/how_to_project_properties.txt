cd to /opt/build/scm/scripts/buildServer/properties/projects
mkdir <repository name>

Depending on the type of project, copy over a project.properties file from a similar project
 - Grails app standalone - Campaign Mgr
 - Grails app with DB - OSS Bar
 - Maven app  - dai-cip-feedback
 - Maven app with DB - dai-smsi-relay


cd into the new direcotry, copy over the project.properties file and edit the following lines and leave the rest alone:


  projectRoot="/opt/checkouts/ops-dt"

   for Grails projects - build_args="grails clean -non-interactive,grails war -non-interactive"
   for Maven projects  build_args=mvn clean install U  DskipTests

build_package {
    artifacts {
        name {
            bin="<the war file name"
            config="where the config files for the project reside"
	    db="<liquibase DB directory>"
	    README="README.md"
        }
        location {
            bin="$projectRoot/$commonTargetRoot/"
            config="$projectRoot"
            db="$projectRoot/$commonTargetRoot"
	    README="$projectRoot"
        }
    }
}
This should get a package built and then we can customize later based on type of project
